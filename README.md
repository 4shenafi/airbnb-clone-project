## 🔍 Feature Breakdown

### 👥 User Management
Handles registration, login, authentication, and user profile management for both guests and hosts.

### 🏘️ Property Management
Allows hosts to create, edit, and delete listings with property details like price, location, and availability.

### 📆 Booking System
Enables users to book available properties for specific dates and manage bookings with status updates.

### 💰 Payment Processing
Processes secure payments for bookings, records transaction details, and provides payment history.

### 🌟 Review System
Allows guests to leave reviews and ratings after stays, enhancing community trust.

### ⚙️ Admin & Host Dashboards *(optional enhancement)*
Provide user-friendly views for managing listings, bookings, and account details.

## 🔐 API Security

Security is a top priority for a platform dealing with personal and payment data. Key measures include:

- **Authentication**: JWT or token-based authentication to verify users.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access (e.g., only hosts can edit properties).
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse by limiting repeated requests.
- **Data Validation**: Protects against injection attacks and invalid input.
- **HTTPS**: All communication is encrypted over HTTPS.

These measures protect user data, ensure secure payments, and maintain trust within the system.

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment**, automating the software delivery process to ensure consistent, tested, and fast deployment of code changes.

### Tools Used

- **GitHub Actions**: Automates testing and deployment workflows.
- **Docker**: Ensures consistent runtime environments across development and production.
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL Containers**: Used in integration testing.

These pipelines help catch errors early, reduce manual intervention, and enable faster iteration.
